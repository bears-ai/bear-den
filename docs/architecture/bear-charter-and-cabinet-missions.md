# Bear charter and Cabinet Missions

A Bear's **charter** is its durable purpose: why this Bear exists and what responsibility boundary its memory, tools, routines, and agents serve.

A Cabinet **Mission** is different. It is a shared work and knowledge container that can involve multiple Bears and contain multiple projects.

## Summary

- A **Bear** is a persistent assistant identity with membership, policy, tools, role agents, and memory boundaries.
- A Bear has one **charter** as a characteristic of the Bear, not as a separate entity.
- Bear-specific knowledge is organized under the Bear through **Domains**, Projects, Routines, Tasks, Runs, Artifacts, memory, and the work surfaces its activity attaches to.
- **Domains** are durable areas of knowledge and responsibility within the Bear's scope.
- **Work surfaces** are the durable work contexts a Bear may act on, such as a repo, local checkout, service, deployment, Cabinet Mission, Docket project, or long-running responsibility.
- Cabinet **Missions** are shared work/knowledge containers and can involve zero, one, or many Bears.
- If a responsibility needs a different identity, memory boundary, policy, membership, or tool profile, create another Bear.

The charter is shown as a field on the Bear because it is descriptive. The Bear itself is the scope.

## Examples

| Bear | Charter |
|------|---------|
| House Bear | Care for the house. |
| SaaS Builder Bear | Build and operate the SaaS product. |
| Executive Assistant Bear | Coordinate the executive's time, communications, and administrative flow. |
| CFO Bear | Maintain financial clarity, forecasting, and budget discipline. |
| PMO Bear | Maintain project portfolio visibility and delivery discipline. |

## Bear-scoped organization

Use these concepts for bear-specific work and knowledge:

| Concept | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Domain | Durable knowledge/responsibility area within the Bear's scope. | smart home, renovations, billing, infrastructure |
| Work surface | Durable work context that plans, tasks, artifacts, memory, and activity can attach to. | BEARS monorepo, a local checkout, production Den deployment, renovation budget |
| Project | Bounded initiative with a desired outcome. | kitchen renovation, Stripe billing v1 |
| Routine | Recurring responsibility. | monthly maintenance review, weekly project digest |
| Task | Executable unit of work. | compare electrician quotes, add webhook tests |
| Run | One execution attempt. | work run 2026-05-09T10:32Z |

Distinct domains, work surfaces, or skills do not imply distinct Bears or Cabinet Missions. For example, smart home, renovations, maintenance, appliances, and contractors can all be Domains or work surfaces for a House Bear whose charter is “Care for the house.”

## Bear memory overview

```text
Bear memory
├── core/
│   ├── charter.md
│   ├── domains.md
│   ├── projects.md
│   ├── current-focus.md
│   ├── decisions.md
│   ├── knowledge.md
│   └── policies.md

├── role-local memory

│   ├── pair/
│   ├── curate/
│   ├── work/
│   └── watch/
│
└── Bear curated archive
    └── derived Letta Archive for semantic recall
```

`core/` is the Bear's canonical shared orientation. Letta Archives are derived semantic indexes over selected canonical content; they are not the source of truth.

For most Bears, the Bear curated archive is the semantic retrieval index for the Bear's charter and Domains.

## Work surfaces and Cabinet Missions

A work surface is not the same thing as a Cabinet Mission.

A work surface is the durable context the Bear is acting on. A Cabinet Mission is a shared Cabinet container for work and knowledge. Sometimes they may align closely, but they are different concepts:

- a work surface may refer to a repo, local checkout, service, deployment, Mission, project, or long-running responsibility,
- a Cabinet Mission may involve one, many, or no Bears,
- one Mission may relate to multiple work surfaces,
- and one work surface may exist without any Cabinet Mission at all.

For repo-oriented work, a local checkout may be the first observed anchor for a work surface and later be canonicalized to a more portable repo-level identity. That continuity story belongs to the work surface, not to Cabinet.

## Cabinet Mission

A Cabinet Mission is a shared work/knowledge container. It can contain:

- projects,
- decisions,
- docs,
- artifacts,
- people/stakeholders,
- links to Bears,
- links to tasks/routines,
- Cabinet pages and references.

A Cabinet Mission may map to:

- one Bear,
- multiple Bears,
- no Bear yet,
- one or more related work surfaces,
- multiple projects,
- multiple domains of work.

Examples:

| Cabinet Mission | Possible Bears involved |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Renovate the kitchen | House Bear, Comms/Scheduling Bear, Finance/CFO Bear |
| Launch SaaS billing | SaaS Builder Bear, CFO Bear, PMO Bear |
| Prepare board meeting | Executive Assistant Bear, CFO Bear, PMO Bear |

## Relationship between Bears and Cabinet Missions

```text
Bear 1 ─┐
        ├── Cabinet Mission A
Bear 2 ─┘

Bear 2 ─┐
        ├── Cabinet Mission B
Bear 3 ─┘

Bear 4 ──── no Cabinet Mission yet
Cabinet Mission C ──── no Bear assigned yet
```

The relationship is many-to-many. A Cabinet Mission is not the Bear's purpose; it is a shared Cabinet object that Bears can participate in.

## When to create another Bear

Create another Bear when the responsibility needs a separate:

- assistant identity,
- membership boundary,
- privacy boundary,
- tool/capability profile,
- policy profile,
- memory boundary,
- operational autonomy.

For example, an Executive Assistant Bear can collaborate with separate Comms/Scheduling, PMO, and CFO Bears instead of one Bear holding every responsibility.

## Archive implications

Cabinet Mission archives are optional. Create one when a Cabinet Mission needs semantic recall shared across Bears or role agents.

Do not create a generic “technical archive” by default. Technical knowledge usually belongs to a Bear Domain, Cabinet Mission, project, task, repo, service, or other work surface.

## Product language

Prefer:

- “This Bear's charter is to care for the house.”
- “Smart home and maintenance are Domains for the House Bear.”
- “This Cabinet Mission involves the House Bear and the Finance Bear.”
- “Work surfaces are the contexts a Bear's plans, tasks, artifacts, memory, and activity can attach to.”
- “Projects can live under a Bear or a Cabinet Mission.”
- “Bears can collaborate on a Mission.”

Avoid:

- “A Bear has many missions” as the default model.
- “A Cabinet Mission is the Bear's purpose.”
- “Different skills always mean different missions.”
- “Every work surface must be a Cabinet Mission.”
- “Bear-specific work is under a Mission by default.”
- “Technical work needs its own archive by default.”

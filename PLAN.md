Here’s a high‑level, ops‑oriented plan and architecture, with an MVP that works **without Cabinet first**, then adds Cabinet/Outline in stages.

I’ll break it into:

1. System architecture (high‑level components and responsibilities)
2. Capability “contracts” (pseudo, not detailed APIs)
3. Project plan: phases and milestones (MVP → Cabinet → polish)

---

## 1. System architecture: components and responsibilities

### Core components

1. **BEARS Core**
   - Identity and session mapping
   - Agent registry and configuration
   - Policy (RBAC, tool/model gating, rate limits)
   - Auth‑aware proxy between:
     - Frontends ↔ Letta
     - Agents ↔ Cabinet (once Cabinet exists)
   - Central logging and observability integration (including LiteLLM).

2. **Letta**
   - Agent runtime (conversation loop + tools).
   - Per‑agent configuration: system prompts, tools, memory adapters.
   - Stateless(ish) from BEARS’ point of view; BEARS passes user/agent IDs and context.

3. **LettaBot**
   - Channel adapters:
     - Slack, WhatsApp (others later).
   - For each message:
     - Authenticate/identify external user,
     - Forward to BEARS with identity + channel metadata,
     - Stream responses back.

4. **OpenWebUI (and any other web/CLI frontends)**
   - Authenticates users (ideally via BEARS or a shared SSO).
   - Forwards chat requests to BEARS instead of directly to Letta.

5. **LiteLLM**
   - Model routing/proxy between Letta and OpenAI (and any other models).
   - Observability hooks (request logs, costs, model usage).
   - Optional: caching / rate‑limiting at the model layer.

6. **Cabinet (later)**
   - Logical service that agents use for long‑term knowledge & history.
   - Backed by:
     - **Outline** (documents, properties, embeddings), and
     - BEARS’ identity and policy.
   - Exposes search/read/write semantics to agents.

7. **Outline**
   - Human knowledge base UI.
   - Stores docs, properties, versions.
   - Optionally uses its own embeddings for search.

---

## 2. Capability “contracts” (pseudo, high‑level)

Not exact APIs, but what each interface *does*.

### 2.1 Frontends → BEARS

**Purpose:** send authenticated user messages to the right Letta agent, get responses back.

**Capabilities:**

- `POST /chat/send`
  - Input: `{ user_token, channel, agent_id, message, metadata }`
    - `user_token`: BEARS or upstream auth token → BEARS resolves to `user_id`.
    - `channel`: `"slack" | "whatsapp" | "webui" | ..."`
    - `agent_id`: which agent to talk to (or default per-channel).
    - `metadata`:
      - `channel_user_id`, `channel_conversation_id`, etc.
  - Behavior:
    - Authenticates `user_token` → `user_id`.
    - Checks policies:
      - Is `agent_id` allowed for this user?
      - Apply rate limits, etc.
    - Constructs a Letta request with:
      - `user_id`, `agent_id`, channel context.
    - Forwards to Letta; streams responses back.
  - Output:
    - Streaming or buffered messages to the frontend.

- `GET /agents/list`
  - Input: `{ user_token }`
  - Output: agents the user is allowed to see/use (for OpenWebUI agent picker).

Later, you can add:

- `GET /usage` (per user, per agent).
- `GET /logs` (for admin/debug).

---

### 2.2 BEARS → Letta (agent invocation)

**Purpose:** call Letta with clear identity and context; Letta returns messages (and tool calls).

You can think of a single RPC:

- `invoke_agent(user_id, agent_id, message, channel_ctx, session_ctx)`

Where:

- `user_id`: BEARS internal ID (stable across Slack/WhatsApp/web).
- `agent_id`: configuration key in Letta.
- `channel_ctx`: `{ channel, channel_user_id, channel_conversation_id }`.
- `session_ctx`: optional (recent messages, conversation ID, etc.) that BEARS or Letta manages.

Letta returns:

- Model messages,
- Tool calls (e.g., `{"tool": "cabinet.search", ...}`),
- Final responses.

BEARS doesn’t need to know Letta’s internal details, just that it can be called with a user+agent context.

---

### 2.3 Agents → BEARS services (via Letta tools)

Two notable services:

#### a) Cabinet (later phase)

Pseudo‑contract:

- `cabinet.search(query, filters) -> [doc_summary]`
  - `filters` might include `kind`, `project`, `tags`, etc.
  - Actually implemented as a BEARS endpoint that calls Outline search.

- `cabinet.get(doc_id) -> full_doc`
- `cabinet.create(kind, title, body, properties) -> doc_id`
- `cabinet.update(doc_id, body?, properties?) -> doc_id`

Agents never talk directly to Outline; they call these tool functions, which BEARS implements in terms of Outline APIs and policies.

#### b) User profile / preferences (optional but nice)

- `user.get_profile(user_id) -> { name, pronouns, preferences, ... }`
- `user.update_preferences(...)`

Even if initially this is just a thin layer over some DB or config, the contract gives you room to grow.

---

### 2.4 BEARS → Outline (Cabinet backend)

**Purpose:** use Outline’s docs, properties, and embeddings as the Cabinet storage.

Capabilities (internal to BEARS):

- `outline.search(query, property_filters) -> docs`
  - Uses Outline’s embeddings + property filters.

- `outline.get_doc(doc_id) -> { title, content, properties }`
- `outline.create_doc(deck_id, title, content, properties) -> doc_id`
- `outline.update_doc(doc_id, content?, properties?)`

BEARS enforces:

- Which decks a given `user_id` and `agent_id` can touch.
- Property schema (kinds, projects, tags, etc.).

---

### 2.5 BEARS ↔ LiteLLM

Letta already uses LiteLLM for model calls and observability.

BEARS’ main concerns:

- **Identity tagging**: ensure Letta passes through enough metadata (`user_id`, `agent_id`, maybe `channel`) so that LiteLLM logs are useful for per‑user/agent observability.
- **Policy linkage**: BEARS’ rate limits and model/agent policies should align with LiteLLM’s logging and possible rate limiting.

No extra public contract required; just configuration and metadata conventions.

---

## 3. Project plan: phased MVP → Cabinet → maturity

### Phase 0 – Foundations / prerequisites

**Goal:** Have basic pieces running in isolation.

- Letta running locally or on your infra.
- LiteLLM configured as Letta’s model proxy.
- OpenWebUI already talking to Letta (your current state).
- LettaBot installed on Slack and (optionally) wired to Letta directly for experiments (no BEARS yet).

Deliverables:
- Working Letta + LiteLLM stack.
- Working Slack bot talking to *some* agent (can be crude).

---

### Phase 1 – BEARS as auth‑aware proxy & agent manager (no Cabinet yet)

**Goal:** Move from “frontends → Letta” to “frontends → BEARS → Letta”, and centralize identity/policy.

**Capabilities to implement:**

1. **Identity and user mapping**
   - Minimal user model: `user_id`, plus mappings:
     - `slack_user_id → user_id`
     - `whatsapp_number → user_id`
     - `webui_account_id → user_id` (if you integrate OpenWebUI auth).
   - Simple auth for web/CLI:
     - Could be shared secret, basic login, or OAuth; doesn’t need to be fancy initially.

2. **Agent registry**
   - A config file or small DB:
     - `agents[agent_id] = { name, description, associated_letta_id, allowed_users_or_roles, tools_enabled, default_model }`.
   - BEARS’ job:
     - Validate `agent_id` requests from frontends.
     - Only allow access based on user permissions.

3. **Chat proxy API**
   - `POST /chat/send`:
     - Accepts message, auth token, optional `agent_id`.
     - Resolves `user_id`.
     - Applies rate limits / policies.
     - Calls `invoke_agent` on Letta.
     - Streams response back.

4. **Frontends switched to BEARS**
   - LettaBot:
     - Instead of calling Letta directly, it calls BEARS `/chat/send`.
   - OpenWebUI:
     - Configure it to talk to BEARS:
       - Either treat BEARS as a “LLM backend with tools”,
       - Or implement a small adapter that maps its requests to `/chat/send`.

5. **LiteLLM observability integration**
   - Ensure that BEARS/Letta:
     - Pass metadata (`user_id`, `agent_id`, `channel`) into LiteLLM’s logging context.
   - Validate that you can see:
     - Per‑user/per‑agent token usage,
     - Which channels are driving the most traffic.

**Phase 1 success:**

- Any user in Slack/WhatsApp/OpenWebUI can talk to an agent via BEARS.
- BEARS knows who they are (internal `user_id`).
- You can list agents per user and enforce basic access rules, even if it’s just “admins vs normal users.”
- No Cabinet/Outline yet; agents operate with short‑term/contextual memory only.

---

### Phase 2 – Introduce Cabinet as an abstract service (Outline still in background)

**Goal:** Define the **Cabinet abstraction** and wire it as Letta tools, while starting with a minimal Outline integration.

**Steps:**

1. **Define Cabinet concepts & schema (on paper/config)**
   - Collections ("Decks"): `knowledge`, `history`, `projects`.
   - Properties:
     - `kind`, `project`, `tags`, `people`, `source`, `status`, etc.
   - Decide which agents can read/write which kinds.

2. **Cabinet service in BEARS (skeleton)**
   - Implement Cabinet endpoints (for agents):
     - `cabinet.search`, `cabinet.get`, `cabinet.create`, `cabinet.update`.
   - Initially, these can return stub data or use a temporary in‑memory store while you finalize behavior.

3. **Letta tools for Cabinet**
   - Define tools the agents can call:
     - `cabinet_search_tool`
     - `cabinet_read_tool`
     - `cabinet_write_tool`
   - Wire them to BEARS’ Cabinet service.
   - Update one or two agents to:
     - Use Cabinet for “remembering” things,
     - Summarizing conversations into “knowledge” notes.

At the end of Phase 2, Cabinet is a defined, testable contract, even if Outline isn’t fully wired.

---

### Phase 3 – Back Cabinet with Outline

**Goal:** Swap out the stub/in‑memory Cabinet backend with a real Outline instance.

**Steps:**

1. **Set up Outline**
   - Deploy Outline (self‑hosted).
   - Configure authentication to match/align with BEARS (SSO, shared provider, or BEARS as OAuth provider if you go that route).
   - Create decks:
     - `Cabinet – Knowledge`
     - `Cabinet – History`
     - `Cabinet – Projects`

2. **Map Cabinet schema to Outline properties**
   - Decide naming for properties:
     - e.g., `kind`, `project`, `tags`, `people`, `source`, `status`.
   - Confirm Outline APIs for:
     - Reading/writing properties,
     - Searching with embeddings + filters.

3. **Implement Outline‑backed Cabinet adapter in BEARS**
   - Implement:
     - `outline.search` → Outline API.
     - `outline.get_doc`, `.create_doc`, `.update_doc`.
   - Implement Cabinet methods on top of that:
     - `cabinet.search` → `outline.search` + property filters.
     - `cabinet.create` → `outline.create_doc` with correct deck and props.
     - `cabinet.update` → `outline.update_doc`.

4. **Update agents to use Cabinet for real**
   - Pick one high‑value agent use case:
     - E.g., “Household Brain” in Slack that:
       - Stores important decisions/summaries in `knowledge`,
       - Logs key events in `history`.
   - Verify:
     - Humans can browse/edit these docs in Outline.
     - Agents can find and reference them later.

**Phase 3 success:**

- Cabinet is real: Outline is the store, agents read/write it via BEARS.
- Human and agent access are governed by the same identity/policy layer in BEARS.
- At least one production‑like workflow uses Cabinet in Slack or OpenWebUI.

---

### Phase 4 – Memory policies, multi‑user ergonomics, and workflows

**Goal:** Make the system pleasant and robust to live with for Hans, Shannon, and others.

**Focus areas:**

1. **Per‑user vs shared Cabinet policies**
   - Decide:
     - Which conversations get summarized into Cabinet automatically,
     - Which notes go into personal vs shared decks,
     - How to tag docs with `people` and `project` for retrievability.

2. **“Librarian” behavior**
   - Add:
     - Scheduled summaries:
       - E.g., daily/weekly “what changed” docs in `history` or `knowledge`.
     - Tools for “promote this to knowledge” from a chat.

3. **RBAC and tool governance**
   - In BEARS:
     - More nuanced rules:
       - Some users/agents can write to `knowledge`,
       - Others only to `history` or read‑only.
     - Restrict dangerous or heavy tools/models to specific roles.

4. **Observability & ops polish**
   - Use LiteLLM + BEARS logs to:
     - Monitor per‑user/per‑agent token usage,
     - Alert on spikes or errors.
   - Build minimal dashboards (could be just Grafana over logs) for:
     - Channel usage,
     - Agent performance.

This is the “make it livable and reliable” phase.

---

## Summary

We’re aiming for:

- **BEARS as the core ops brain**:
  - Identity, policy, routing, observability.
  - Managing Letta agents and LettaBot configs.
  - Exposing Cabinet to agents and keeping Cabinet/Outline auth aligned with human auth.

- **Phased delivery**:
  - **MVP (Phase 1):** BEARS proxy with multi‑user chat via Letta; no Cabinet yet.
  - **Phase 2:** Cabinet abstraction defined and wired as tools (even if stubbed).
  - **Phase 3:** Cabinet backed by Outline with properties + embeddings.
  - **Phase 4:** Refine memory policies, multi‑user ergonomics, RBAC, and workflows.

If you want to go one level deeper next, we can pick one phase (probably Phase 1) and outline concrete tasks and acceptance criteria (e.g., “what needs to work by the end of an MVP weekend”).
